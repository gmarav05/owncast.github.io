Happy 5 years! This month marks 5 years of Owncast. It&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and there&amp;rsquo;s still so much more planned. Thank you for being patient during this time when it&amp;rsquo;s primarily architectural updates, bug fixes, and small quality of life improvements that are being shipped before we can get to the big features.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.2.2</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.2.2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.2.2/</guid><description>Happy 5 years!

Three years of Owncast! The first commit to Owncast was May 23, 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wild ride seeing what everyone has been streaming and all the creative use cases people have come up with. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the project, and to everyone who has been using it.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.13</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.13/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.13/</guid><description>Owncast v0.0.13 is a very small release targeting mostly bug fixes.
Since v0.1.0 is taking longer than hoped, this allows some updates to get out between now and then. But all the work for the new Owncast interface is coming along well and I look forward to getting it finished and putting in everyone&amp;rsquo;s hands.
